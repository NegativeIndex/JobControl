All the python codes about job information and job manipulation on
Argon cluster at University of Iowa.


Motivation
==========

My job is to run thousands of simulations everyday. I need a tool to
track the jobs, so I bulit one myself.


process_job_info.py
===================

Currently, the program provdes a function *process_job_info.py*, which
can analyze the job.info files and provide a report.


qstat_kill_jobs.py
==================

Nest step, I will write *qstat_kill_jobs.py* command, which can kill
jobs based all kinds of options.
